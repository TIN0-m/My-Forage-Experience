# My Forage experience
Participated in comprehensive job simulations via The Forage platform (theforage.com), meticulously designed to mirror the demands of a Security Operations Center Analyst. This hands-on experience significantly deepened my understanding of a SOC Analyst's critical functions, from conducting in-depth analysis of phishing attempts to contributing to robust risk assessment strategies. It provided a tangible feel for the responsibilities essential in a dynamic cybersecurity environment.
